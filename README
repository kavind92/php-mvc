DESCRIPTION :

    What is MVC?
    
    MVC is an Model-View-Controller application framework for PHP.
    Its design goals are to minimally provide separation between the database
    operations (Model), the presentation (View), and the glue in between
    (Controller). With very little extras bundled in, this framework is
    extremely fast and flexible. Some design aspects and terminology of MVC
    have been inspired by other PHP frameworks, although the code is 100%
    original.

    What MVC is NOT
    
    MVC is NOT a full-featured framework. As it stands, it is a simple
    MVC structure with a database support layer (MYSQLI-Procedural, 
    MYSQLI-object oriented, PDO). Any features user desire (form validation, 
    session handling, etc.) are easily added with own libraries or helpers. 
    libraries will become available in the wiki as
    they are programmed or contributed by other users. If a libraries is
    essential enough, it may eventually find its way to the core distribution.


REQUIREMENTS:    
    
    MVC requires PHP 5. The bundled database library requires MYSQLI,PDO,
    which is included with PHP 5.1 and up.
   
   
FEATURES:

    MVC supplies easy separation between Model, View and
    Controller, and supports MYSQLI,PDO for the database abstraction layer. Each
    and every component of MVC is customizable with class extensions,
    and the framework is easily extended with your own Libraries.
    
    Multiple applications are also easy to handle. user can drop libraries
    in at the application level. The file structure is setup so your 
    customizations are kept isolated from the core, so updates are easy to 
    maintain.
